# Project: Movie Tracker

### Group Member Names:
* Lindsay Parker, George Goering, and JC

### Project Expectations: What does each group member hope to get out of this project?
* Lindsay: Some level of familiarity with Router & Redux. Another successful team project.
* George:
* JC: Better understanding of react/redux and how they work together. Reinforcing Promises with API calls, and testing API calls.

### Goals and expectations:
* Lindsay: Comfortable balance of tasks across the three of us, balance of driver-navigator and individual work.
* George:
* JC: My goal is to get a project at the end of this that I am proud to put in my portfolio.

### Team strengths:
* Lindsay: Organization, communication, design
* George:
* JC: Good SQL and database understanding. Big picture thinking. Solid JavaScript skillz. I have a beard.

### How to overcome obstacles:
* Lindsay: Ask for help only after struggling for 30-45 minutes with little progress.
* George:
* JC: I think we keep in constant communication, and work through problems as a team. I trust you both and I'm totally fine with decisions only requiring two people.

### Schedule Expectations (When are we available to work together and individually?):
* Lindsay: Anytime outside Saturday 10a-4p, Sunday 9-11a.  Usually on campus by 7:45a, leave by 6p, though I'm available to screenhero in the evenings.
* George:
* JC: There will be a night (yet undetermined) where I'll need to tend to my family. Other than that, I can be at school by 8am every morning and I can stay as late as needed. I can also work on the project on Saturday and Sunday.

### Communication Expectations (How often will we communicate? How do we keep lines of communication open?):
* Lindsay: Communicate early.  Pre-schedule face-to-face feedback session(s).
* George:
* JC: I propose we check in every morning (Sat and Sun we can just drop an update in Slack) with a quick standup where we basically update each other on anything accomplished the previous night.

### Abilities Expectations (Technical strengths and areas for desired improvement):
* Lindsay: Decent @ React, plenty of room for improvement with Redux & Router.  Fetch is decent, but practice couldn't hurt!
* George:
* JC: I'd like to get better at testing the complex interactions. It's easy to go for the low hanging fruit, but I want to get better at the more difficult testing scenarios.

### Workload Expectations (What features do we each want to work on?):
* Lindsay: Definitely involved with the new material, then my fair share of the material we're all comfortable with.
* George:
* JC: I think if we all give 100%, the workload should net out pretty evenly.

### Workflow Expectations (Git workflow/Tools/Code Review/Reviewing Pull Requests):
* Lindsay:  All the usual suspects.  Clean master. Period.
* George:
* JC: Keep the master pristine, use PR's for code reviews, keep the commits small and atomic.

### Expectations for giving and receiving feedback:
* Lindsay:  Constructive.  Early and often, in a respectful & trustworthy way.
* George:
* JC: The sooner, the better. I'd rather not let feedback wait, since it's likely an opportunity to grow and improve.

### Agenda to discuss project launch:
* Tuesday, June 11. Initial breakdown of work for the first 2 phases, with cards added to the project tracking tool.

### Ideas:
* TBD

### Tools:
* Our brains. And Waffle for project tracking.
